    <h1>Rules and strategies</h1>
    <div>
    <h2>Object of the game:</h2>
    <p>
        Players who have the most building tiles of each kind in their Alhambra in the scoring rounds, are awarded points. The amount of points depends on the type of building. Players who receive points for the longest part of wall they have built around their Alhambra.
        More points are awarded in each scoring round. The winner is the player who has been awarded the most points by the end of the game.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h2>Getting ready to play:</h2>
    <p>
        Each player is given a starting tile and 2 counters in the colour of their choice. One counter is placed on the starting tile and the other on the scoring board. The 54 building tiles are shuffled in a bag. 4 tiles are taken randomly out of the bag and placed on the building market. Each player is given a tile reserve board with a points table. The points table shows how many there are of each kind of building tile and how many points can be won with them.</p>
    <p>The two scoring cards are taken from the pack of money cards and put to one side for the time being. The rest of the pack is shuffled. Each player now gets their starting money. The player receives money cards until their total is 20 or more. From now on each player’s money is kept secret. The player with the fewest cards starts. If two or more players are equal, the player with the lowest amount of money starts. Finally, 4 more cards are laid face-up in the middle of the table next to the building market. The rest of the money cards are divided into five equal piles. The first scoring round card is put into the seconds pile and the 2nd scoring card into the fourth. Then the piles are put on top of one another chronologically, with the fifth pile on the bottom.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h2>How to play:</h2>
        <div class="second">
    <p>The players whose turn it is must do one of the three options:</p>
        </div>
        <div class="first" >
    <h3>Take some money</h3>
    <p>
        A player can take any one of the money cards from those lying face-up, or several money cards if they do not add up to more than 5.
    </p>
        </div>
        <div class="second">
    <h3>Buy and position a building tile</h3>
    <h4>Buying the tiles:</h4>
    <p>
        A player can buy a building tile from the building market. He must pay at least the price shown on the tile, in the right currency. The currency is displayed next to the tile in the building market (the coin).
    </p>
    <p>
        After a player’s turn is over any money cards and building tiles which have been removed are replaced with new ones so that there are always 4 of each. The money used to pay is now discarded.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you can pay the exact amount it is still your turn and you can decide once more which of the three options you would like to take.
    </p>
    <p>
        While it is your turn no new tiles are placed on the building market. It is only at the end of your turn that the empty squares are refilled with new ones. It is therefore possible to carry out a maximum of 5 actions during your turn.
    </p>
        </div>
            <div class="first">
    <h4>Positioning the tiles:</h4>
    <p>
        You can either add your new building to your Alhambra or place it on your reserve board. You can have as many building tiles on your reserve board as you want.
    </p>
            </div>
            <div class="second">
    <h4>Rules for building your Alhambra:</h4>
    <p>
        All building tiles must be the same way round as your starting tile (all roofs must point upwards).
    </p>
    <p>
        Adjoining sides must be the same. They must either both have a wall or both not have a wall.
    </p>
    <p>
        You must be able to reach each new building tile “on foot” from the starting tile without crossing any wall and without going of the tiles.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each new tile must be joined to your Alhambra by at least one side.
    </p>
    <p>
        You must not leave any “spaces”. An empty area surrounded on all sides by building tiles.
    </p>
        </div>
        <div class="first">
    <h3>Redesign their Alhambra</h3>
    <p>There are three ways in which you can redesign your Alhambra:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Take a building tile from your serve board and add it to your Alhambra.</li>
        <li>Remove a building tile from your Alhambra and put it on your reserve board.</li>
        <li>Exchange a building tile on your reserve board for one in your Alhambra.</li></ul>
    <p>
        When you are redesigning your Alhambra you must still follow the building rules. You are not allowed to remove the starting tile or exchange it for another tile. When you exchange a tile, the new building tile in your Alhambra must go in exactly the same place as the one you remove.
    </p>
    <h4>At the end of your turn</h4>
    <p>
        It is only right at the end of your turn, after any redesigning tiles you may have carried out, that you add the building tiles you have bought to your Alhambra or place them on your reserve board. You can add the newly bought building tiles in any order you wish.
    </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h2>Scoring:</h2>
    <p>
        There are 3 scoring rounds during this game. The first two take place when the scoring cards are drawn from the pile of money cards. The third and final scoring round takes place at the end of the game. The points awarded to a player are recorded on the scoring board. Each player moves their counter one space forward for each point.
    </p>
    <p>
        When a scoring card is drawn it is put to one side and the next card or cards are used to make the number of money cards up to four. But before the next player starts his turn the scores are calculated.
        In each scoring round, points are awarded to whoever has the most of each kind of building. Players are also given points for the length of the wall around their Alhambra’s.
        You get points for having the most of each kind of building. The number of points a player receives depends on which kind of building it is.
        In each case, the player with the most buildings is awarded the points for the 1st place indicated on the scoring card next to the name of the building.
    </p>
    <p>
        Only the players with the most buildings of each kind receive points when the “1st scoring round” card is drawn. Points are awarded in the later rounds as follows: in the “2nd scoring round”, points are awarded to the players with the highest number and second highest number of building tiles of each kind. If several players tie, the points are shared.
    </p>
    <p>
        The 3rd round of scoring takes place at the end of the game; points are then also awarded to the players with the third highest number of buildings of each kind as shown in the example and on the points table on the tile reserve board.
    </p>
    <h3>Points for the wall around your Alhambra:</h3>
    <p>
        In this round players are awarded extra points for the size of their longest joined wall around their Alhambras. Each wall on a side of a tile counts for 1 point.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div>
    <h2>The end of the game:</h2>
    <p>
        The game ends when – at the end of a player’s turn – there are not enough building tiles left in the bag to bring the total up to four again.
    </p>
    <p>
        The remaining building tiles from the building market are given the the players who have the most money of the respective currency in their hand. If two players tie, the building remains on the building market. The third and final scoring round now takes place. The player who leads on the scoring board after this last round has won.
