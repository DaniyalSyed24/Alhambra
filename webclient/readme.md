# Alhambra web project group [number]

## Important URLs  
* Remote API: http://172.21.22.52:48201/alhambra-api/
* Swagger UI: testing http://172.21.22.52:48201/alhambra-api-ui/
* Sonar reports: http://172.21.23.0/sonar/projects


## Install swagger plugin for IntelliJ
Install "OpenAPI"'s swagger plugin for IntelliJ. This will allow you to preview the resources/alhambra.yaml file in the browser if you were to add anything to the API by extension (once you program the server)

## Default files
### Images
You'll find some of Alhambra's default images in the `images` and `assets/media` directories. Using these is optional. You have permission to use graphics of your own choosing. 

If you do use them, you are allowed to change in which folder they live. This is an initial proposal. 

### CSS 
The `reset.css` has aleady been supplied, but it's up to you and your team to add the rest of the styles. Please feel free to split those up in multiple files. We'll handle efficient delivery for products in production in later semesters. 

### JavaScript
A demonstration for connecting with the API has already been set up. We urge you to separate your JS files as **atomically as possible**. Add folders as you please.
